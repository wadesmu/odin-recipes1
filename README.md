my second attempt at learning how to code. 
In my first attempt, In may of 2022, roughly 6 months ago, I thought learning to code would be really fast. I was incredibly naive back then. Now, I am relearning what I had forgotten over the 6 months. This time I will commit though, because I kind of have to. (For my CAS project in the IB diploma). I hope I learn the importance of consistency and discipline during this journey. I will not give up. Great things happen over time.
