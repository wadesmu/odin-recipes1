    <p>This is a dish I often look forward to after a long day. These wings are filling and are delicious.</p>
    <br>
    <p>P.S. Dad was busy cooking dinner so I couldn't ask him what made the chickenwings. So I am using a recipe from foodnetwork.com</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Canola oil, for frying</li>
        <li>24 chicken wing parts (12 wings separated into 2 pieces</li>
        <li>One 12-ounce bottle cayenne hot pepper sauce, such as Frank's</li>
        <li>1 stick butter</li>
        <li>Several dashes Worchestershire sauce</li>
        <li>Several dashes hot sauce, such as Tabasco</li>
        <li>Blue cheese dip, for serving</li>
        <li>Celery sticks, for serving</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>#1 Preheat the oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit. Heat 3 inches of canola oil in a heavy pot to 375 degrees Fahrenheit</li>
        <li>Add half of the chicken wings to the oil and fry them until they are golden brown and fully cooked. This will take 5 to 7 minutes. Remove them afterwards, and then drain them on paper towels
            Repeat this process with the other half of the chicken wings. In a saucepan, heat the cayenne sauce and butter over medium-low heat. Then add the Worcestershire and hot sauce. Let it bubble up, and then turn off the heat. Then, place the wings in an ovenproof dish and pour the hot sauce over the top. Toss to coat, and then bake in the oven for 15 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>#3 Serve with blue cheese dip, or celery sticks, and add your favorite cold and fizzy beverage.</li>
    </ol>
